            <p>ManageMR provides clinicians with personalized referral and treatment advice for diagnosed mitral regurgitation patients by verifying the severity and etiology of the MR. For optimal use:</p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Conduct a clinical assessment of your patient with suspected chronic mitral regurgitation, including assessment of qualitative and quantitative parameters, symptoms, exercise tolerance, physical exam and chamber sizes </li>
