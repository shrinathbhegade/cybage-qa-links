                        <p>∗ For example, in the Treating to New Targets trial, patients with CHD who received 10 mg of atorvastatin daily had a 5-y event rate of 10.9%, and those who received 80 mg of atorvastatin daily had a 5-y event rate of 8.7%. These numbers (and similar rates from other trials) may inform the number-needed-to-treat. Additional consideration of comorbidities and other poorly controlled or well-controlled risk factors will increase or decrease risk accordingly. See Table 1 for criteria for defining patients at very high risk.</p>

                        <p>† Use the Pooled Cohort Equations to estimate 10-y ASCVD risk. See Table 1 for criteria for defining patients at very high risk.</p>

                        <p>‡ Such evidence exists for ezetimibe from the IMPROVE-IT study, with a 6% relative/2% absolute risk reduction in a composite ASCVD endpoint over 7 y when added to a moderate-intensity statin. Evidence from FOURIER and ODYSSEY Outcomes demonstrate 2% absolute/15% relative ASCVD risk reduction. Data are lacking for addition of BAS to statins, bempedoic acid, inclisiran, and evinacumab. Niacin preparations have been associated with no benefit and potential for significant harms when added to statin therapy.</p>

                        <p>§ For example, patients on maximally-tolerated statin therapy with LDL-C ≥130 mg/dL may receive more benefit from the addition of a nonstatin therapy than those with on-statin LDL-C of 80 mg/dL.</p>

                        <p>‖For example, when added to statins, ezetimibe may lower LDL-C an additional 20%-25% on average; PCSK9 inhibitors may lower LDL-C an additional 60% on average. For each 40-mg/dL reduction in LDL-C using safe and evidence-based therapies, there appears to be an approximate 20% relative risk reduction in ASCVD. This number, combined with the baseline absolute risk, may inform the number-needed-to-treat.</p>

                              In most patients, the postprandial rise in triglycerides is small, between 12 and 27 mg/dL. The 2018 AHA/ACC/ multisociety cholesterol guideline recommends that for adults aged > 20 years not taking lipid-lowering drug therapy, either a fasting or nonfasting lipid profile may be used to estimate ASCVD risk and document baseline LDL-C. For those with nonfasting triglycerides > 400 mg/dL, a repeat fasting lipid profile is recommended to assess fasting triglycerides and baseline LDL-C. The Martin-Hopkins method provides accurate assessments of LDL-C in individuals with hypertriglyceridemia. Fasting lipid testing is favored under the following circumstances: a) To establish the diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome, as one of the criteria is fasting triglycerides > 150 mg/dL b) To identify lipid disorders in those without ASCVD, but with a family history of premature ASCVD or genetic lipid disorders c) To assess adherence to lifestyle and medical therapy in those being treated with lipid-lowering medication d) To identify those with triglycerides > 500 mg/dL, who are at risk for hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis, and monitor their response to therapy.

                              It is crucial that clinicians investigate and treat secondary causes of hypertriglyceridemia. Diseases, diet/lifestyle, medications, and disorders of metabolism are major causes for elevation of triglycerides that clinicians can use to rule out secondary causes of hypertriglyceridemia. These factors can either cause or contribute to triglyceride elevations in patients. Poor glycemic control may significantly influence plasma lipid levels in patients with diabetes mellitus and significantly exacerbate hypertriglyceridemia. A genetic predisposition to hypertriglyceridemia increases the likelihood and severity of elevated triglycerides in each category. Multifactorial chylomicronemia syndrome is the most common condition that elevates triglyceride levels high enough to cause lipemia retinalis, eruptive xanthomas, abdominal pain, and hyperlipidemic pancreatitis. Clinicians should understand the drugs and conditions which make this disease more likely as pancreatitis associated with hypertriglyceridemia can be fatal.

                           Lifestyle modification (ie, adherence to a heart-healthy diet, regular physical activity, avoidance of tobacco products, limited alcohol consumption, and maintenance of a healthy weight) remains a critical component of ASCVD risk reduction, both before and in concert with the use of lipid-lowering medications. Referral to a registered dietitian nutritionist is strongly recommended to improve understanding of heart-healthy dietary principles and individualize nutrition recommendations for patients with hypertriglyceridemia. Given that metabolic risk factors such as hypertriglyceridemia cluster with other metabolic risk factors (abdominal obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia), adherence to a recommended dietary intervention can markedly benefit the entire metabolic risk profile over the life course. Adherence to lifestyle modification should be regularly assessed at the time of initiation or modification of statin therapy and at each patient visit during monitoring of ongoing therapy.

                              Although commonly recognized for their impact on LDL-C, statins also provide a 10 to 30% dose-dependent triglyceride reduction in patients with elevated triglyceride levels. Trials have demonstrated those with elevated triglyceride levels are at increased risk of ASCVD events and can achieve ASCVD risk reduction with statin therapy.

                             Persistently elevated triglycerides (nonfasting triglycerides > 175 mg/dL) are one of the risk-enhancing factors identified by the 2018 AHA/ACC/multisociety cholesterol guideline, according to which the 10-year ASCVD risk derived using the Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) is a useful tool to predict population risk. However, clinicians should be aware that it has limitations when applied to individuals. The PCE may overestimate risk in individuals from higher socioeconomic status, as well as in those receiving consistent screening and preventive care. One purpose of the discussion is to individualize risk status based on the PCE estimate as well as other factors. These factors may suggest a higher lifetime risk than is denoted by the 10-year risk estimate with the PCE.

                                      Nonprescription fish oil products are classified as dietary supplements and are not interchangeable with prescription omega-3 products. Unlike the prescription omega-3 fatty acid products, the supplements are not approved by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration to treat elevated triglyceride levels. In addition, the manufacturing process for supplements is not regulated to the same degree as the manufacturing process for prescription medications.

                                      Some supplements may contain impurities, including saturated fat and oxidized lipids, contaminants, or other ingredients that may be harmful. With some supplements, large quantities of the capsules may be required to get the same amount of the active ingredient as in the prescription-strength fish oil. With the larger pill burden, the supplements can contribute to an increased daily caloric intake. In addition, fish oil supplements may not be as well tolerated as the prescription omega-3 products. It is common for patients to complain of gastrointestinal side effects (eg, burping, fishy taste in mouth, dyspepsia) while taking the supplements.

                                      Nonprescription fish oil products are not recommended for ASCVD risk reduction. The most frequent adverse effects of prescription omega-3 fatty acid preparations include eructation, dyspepsia, taste perversion for ethyl ester preparations and musculoskeletal pain, peripheral edema, constipation, gout, and AF for IPE.

                                        It is important that clinicians evaluate the potential net benefit of prescription omega-3 fatty acids in patients at high risk of AF. At the time of this publication, the only triglyceride risk-based nonstatin therapy approved for reduction in ASCVD risk by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration is IPE. The treatment is an ethyl ester of EPA and is indicated:

                        <p>∗ For example, in the Treating to New Targets trial, patients with CHD who received 10 mg of atorvastatin daily had a 5-y event rate of 10.9%, and those who received 80 mg of atorvastatin daily had a 5-y event rate of 8.7%. These numbers (and similar rates from other trials) may inform the number-needed-to-treat. Additional consideration of comorbidities and other poorly controlled or well-controlled risk factors will increase or decrease risk accordingly. See Table 1 for criteria for defining patients at very high risk.</p>

                        <p>† Use the Pooled Cohort Equations to estimate 10-y ASCVD risk. See Table 1 for criteria for defining patients at very high risk.</p>

                        <p>‡ Such evidence exists for ezetimibe from the IMPROVE-IT study, with a 6% relative/2% absolute risk reduction in a composite ASCVD endpoint over 7 y when added to a moderate-intensity statin. Evidence from FOURIER and ODYSSEY Outcomes demonstrate 2% absolute/15% relative ASCVD risk reduction. Data are lacking for addition of BAS to statins, bempedoic acid, inclisiran, and evinacumab. Niacin preparations have been associated with no benefit and potential for significant harms when added to statin therapy.</p>

                        <p>§ For example, patients on maximally-tolerated statin therapy with LDL-C ≥130 mg/dL may receive more benefit from the addition of a nonstatin therapy than those with on-statin LDL-C of 80 mg/dL.</p>

                        <p>‖For example, when added to statins, ezetimibe may lower LDL-C an additional 20%-25% on average; PCSK9 inhibitors may lower LDL-C an additional 60% on average. For each 40-mg/dL reduction in LDL-C using safe and evidence-based therapies, there appears to be an approximate 20% relative risk reduction in ASCVD. This number, combined with the baseline absolute risk, may inform the number-needed-to-treat.</p>

                                  The 10-year calculated ASCVD risk is a
                                  quantitative estimation of absolute risk based
                                  upon data from representative population
                                  samples.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  The 10-year risk estimate for "optimal risk
                                  factors" is represented by the following
                                  specific risk factor numbers for an individual
                                  of the same age, sex and race: Total
                                  cholesterol of &le; 170 mg/dL, HDL-cholesterol
                                  of &ge; 50 mg/dL, untreated systolic blood
                                  pressure of &le; 110 mm Hg, no diabetes
                                  history, and not a current smoker.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  While the risk estimate is applied to
                                  individuals, it is based on group averages.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  Just because two individuals have the same
                                  estimated risk does not mean that they will or
                                  will not have the same event of interest.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  Example: If the 10-year ASCVD risk estimate is
                                  10%, this indicates that among 100 patients
                                  with the entered risk factor profile, 10 would
                                  be expected to have a heart attack or stroke
                                  in the next 10 years.

                                  The division of lifetime risk by these 5
                                  strata leads to thresholds in the data with
                                  large apparent changes in lifetime risk

                                  Example: An individual that has all optimal
                                  risk factors except for a systolic blood
                                  pressure of 119 mm Hg has a lifetime ASCVD
                                  risk of 5%. In contrast, a similar individual
                                  that has all optimal risk factors except for a
                                  systolic blood pressure of 120 mm Hg has a
                                  lifetime ASCVD risk of 36%. This substantial

                        Understanding My Cardiovascular Risk
                      </h1>
                      <p>
                        The "2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Assessment of
                        Cardiovascular Risk" provides clear recommendations for
                        estimating cardiovascular disease risk. Risk assessments
                        are extremely useful when it comes to reducing risk for
                        cardiovascular disease because they help determine
                        whether a patient is at high risk for cardiovascular
                        disease, and if so, what can be done to address any
                        cardiovascular risk factors a patient may have. Here are
                        the highlights of the guideline:
                      </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          <p>
                            Risk assessments are used to determine the
                            likelihood of a patient developing cardiovascular
                            disease, heart attack or stroke in the future. In
                            general, patients at higher risk for cardiovascular
                            disease require more intensive treatment to help
                            prevent the development of cardiovascular disease.
                          </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p>
                            Risk assessments are calculated using a number of
                            factors including age, gender, race, cholesterol and
                            blood pressure levels, diabetes and smoking status,
                            and the use of blood pressure-lowering medications.
                            Typically, these factors are used to estimate a
                            patient's risk of developing cardiovascular disease
                            in the next 10 years. For example, someone who is
                            young with no risk factors for cardiovascular
                            disease would have a very low 10-year risk for
                            developing cardiovascular disease. However, someone
                            who is older with risk factors like diabetes and
                            high blood pressure will have a much higher risk of
                            developing cardiovascular disease in the next 10
                            years.
                          </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p>
                            If a preventive treatment plan is unclear based on
                            the calculation of risk outlined above, care
                            providers should take into account other factors
                            such as family history and level of C-reactive
                            protein. Taking this additional information into
                            account should help inform a treatment plan to
                            reduce a patient's 10-year risk of developing
                            cardiovascular disease.
                          </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p>
                            Calculating the 10-year risk for cardiovascular
                            disease using traditional risk factors is
                            recommended every 4-6 years in patients 20-79 years
                            old who are free from cardiovascular disease.
                            However, conducting a more detailed 10-year risk
                            assessment every 4-6 years is reasonable in adults
                            ages 40-79 who are free of cardiovascular disease.
                            Assessing a patient's 30-year risk of developing
                            cardiovascular disease can also be useful for
                            patients 20-59 years of age who are free of
                            cardiovascular disease and are not at high
                            short-term risk for cardiovascular disease.
                          </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p>
                            Risk estimations vary drastically by gender and
                            race. Patients with the same traditional risk
                            factors for cardiovascular disease such as high
                            blood pressure can have a different 10-year risk for
                            cardiovascular disease as a result of their sex and
                            race.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            After care providers and patients work together to
                            conduct a risk assessment, it's important that they
                            discuss the implications of their findings.
                            Together, patients and their care providers should
                            weigh the risks and benefits of various treatments
                            and lifestyle changes to help reduce the risk of
                            developing cardiovascular disease.

                        Diet and Physical Activity Recommendations
                      </h1>
                      <p>
                        The "2013 AHA/ACC Guideline on Lifestyle Management to
                        Reduce Cardiovascular Risk" provides recommendations for
                        heart-healthy lifestyle choices based on the latest
                        research and evidence. The guidelines focus on two
                        important lifestyle choices--diet and physical
                        activity--which can have a drastic impact on
                        cardiovascular health. Here's what every patient should
                        know about the latest recommendations for reducing
                        cardiovascular disease risk through diet and exercise.
                      </p>
                      <h3>Diet</h3>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          Diet is a vital tool for lowering cholesterol and
                          blood pressure levels, which are two major risk
                          factors for cardiovascular disease.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Patients with high cholesterol and high blood pressure
                          levels should eat plenty of vegetables, fruits and
                          whole grains and incorporate low-fat dairy products,
                          poultry, fish, legumes, non-tropical vegetable oils
                          and nuts into their diet. They should also limit
                          intake of sweets, sugar-sweetened beverages and red
                          meats.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          There are many helpful strategies for heart-healthy
                          eating, including the DASH diet and the USDA's Choose
                          My Plate.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Patients who need to lower their cholesterol should
                          reduce saturated and trans fat intake. Ideally, only
                          5-6% of daily caloric intake should come from
                          saturated fat.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Patients with high blood pressure should consume no
                          more than 2,400 mg of sodium a day, ideally reducing
                          sodium intake to 1,500 mg a day. However, even
                          reducing sodium intake in one's current diet by 1,000
                          mg each day can help lower blood pressure.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          It's important to adapt the recommendations
                          above, keeping in mind calorie requirements, as well
                          as, personal and cultural food preferences. Nutrition
                          therapy for other conditions like diabetes should also
                          be considered. Doing so helps create healthy eating
                          patterns that are realistic and sustainable.
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                      <h3>Physical Activity</h3>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          Regular physical activity helps lower cholesterol and
                          blood pressure, reducing the risk for cardiovascular
                          disease.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          In general, adults should engage in aerobic physical
                          activity 3-4 times a week with each session lasting an
                          average of 40 minutes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Moderate (brisk walking or jogging) to vigorous
                          (running or biking) physical activity is recommended
                          to reduce cholesterol levels.
                        </li>
                      </ul>

                        Weight Management Recommendations
                      </h1>
                      <p>
                        The "2013 AHA/ACC/TOS Guideline for the Management of
                        Overweight and Obesity in Adults" was created to reflect
                        the latest research to outline best practices when it
                        comes to treating obesity--a condition that affects more
                        than one-third of American adults. These guidelines help
                        address questions like "What's the best way to lose
                        weight?" and "When is bariatric surgery appropriate?".
                        Here is what every patient should know about the
                        treatment of overweight and obesity:

                            <strong> Definition of obesity: </strong>
                            Obesity is a medical condition in which excess body
                            fat has accumulated to the extent that it can have
                            an adverse effect on one's health. Obesity can be
                            diagnosed using body mass index (BMI), a measurement
                            of height and weight, as well as waist
                            circumference. Obesity is categorized as having a
                            BMI of 30 or greater. Abdominal obesity is defined
                            as having a waist circumference greater than 40
                            inches for a man or 35 inches for a woman.

                            <strong> Benefits of weight loss: </strong>
                            Obesity increases the risk for serious conditions
                            such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and death,
                            but losing just a little bit of weight can result in
                            significant health benefits. For an adult who is
                            obese, losing just 3-5% of body weight can improve
                            blood pressure and cholesterol levels and reduce the
                            risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
                            Ideally, care providers recommend 5-10% weight loss
                            for obese adults, which can produce even greater
                            health benefits.

                            <strong> Weight loss strategies: </strong>
                            There is no single diet or weight loss program that
                            works best for all patients. In general, reduced
                            caloric intake and a comprehensive lifestyle
                            intervention involving physical activity and
                            behavior modification tailored according to a
                            patient's preferences and health status is most
                            successful for sustained weight loss. Further,
                            weight loss interventions should include frequent
                            visits with health care providers and last more than
                            one year for sustained weight loss.

                            <strong> Bariatric Surgery: </strong>
                            Bariatric surgery may be a good option for severely
                            obese patients to reduce their risk of health
                            complications and improve overall health. However,
                            bariatric surgery should be reserved for only the
                            highest risk patients until more evidence is
                            available on this issue. Present guidelines advise
                            that weight loss surgery is only recommended for
                            patients with extreme obesity (BMI &ge;40) or in
                            patients that have a BMI &ge;35 in addition to a
                            chronic health condition.

                        Blood Cholesterol Management Recommendations
                      </h1>
                      <p>
                        The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the
                        American Heart Association (AHA) recently developed new
                        standards for treating blood cholesterol. These
                        recommendations are based on a thorough and careful
                        review of the very latest, highest quality clinical
                        trial research. They help care providers deliver the
                        best care possible. This page provides some of the
                        highlights from the new practice guidelines. The
                        ultimate goal of the new cholesterol practice guidelines
                        is to reduce a person's risk of heart attack, stroke and
                        death. For this reason, the focus is not just on
                        measuring and treating cholesterol, but identifying
                        whether someone already has or is at risk for
                        atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and could
                        benefit from treatment.
                      </p>
                      <h3>What is ASCVD?</h3>
                      <p>
                        Heart attack and stroke are usually caused by
                        atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). ASCVD
                        develops because of a build-up of sticky
                        cholesterol-rich plaque. Over time, this plaque can
                        harden and narrow the arteries.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        These practice guidelines outline the most effective
                        treatments that lower blood cholesterol in those
                        individuals most likely to benefit. Most importantly,
                        they were selected as the best strategies to lower
                        cholesterol to help reduce future heart attack or stroke
                        risk. Share this information with your health care
                        provider so that you can ask questions and work together
                        to decide what is right for you.
                      </p>
                      <h3>Key Points</h3>
                      <p>
                        Based on the most up-to-date and complete look at
                        available clinical trial results:
                      </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          <p>
                            Health care providers should focus on identifying
                            those people who are most likely to have a heart
                            attack or stroke and make sure they are given
                            effective treatment to reduce their risk.
                          </p>
                        </li>

                          <p>
                            Cholesterol should be considered along with other
                            factors known to make a heart attack or stroke more
                            likely.
                          </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p>
                            Knowing your risk of heart attack and stroke can
                            help you and your health care provider decide
                            whether you may need to take a medication&mdash;most
                            likely a statin&mdash;to lower that risk.
                          </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p>
                            If a medication is needed, statins are recommended
                            as the first choice to lower heart attack and stroke
                            risk among certain higher-risk patients based on an
                            overwhelming amount of evidence. For those unable to
                            take a statin, there are other cholesterol-lowering
                            drugs; however, there is less research to support
                            their use.
                          </p>

                      </ul>
                      <h3>Evaluating Your Risk</h3>
                      <p>
                        Your health care provider will first want to assess your
                        risk of ASCVD (assuming you don't already have it). This
                        information will help determine if you are at high
                        enough risk of a heart attack or stroke to need
                        treatment.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        To do this, your care provider will 1) review your
                        medical history and 2) gauge your overall risk for heart
                        attack or stroke. He/she will likely want to know:
                      </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          <p>
                            whether you have had a heart attack, stroke or
                            blockages in the arteries of your heart, neck, or
                            legs.
                          </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p>
                            your risk factors. In addition to your total
                            cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL (so-called
                            "good") cholesterol, your health care provider will
                            consider your age, if you have diabetes, and whether
                            you smoke and/or have high blood pressure.
                          </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <p>
                            about your lifestyle habits, other medical
                            conditions, any previous drug treatments, and if
                            anyone in your family has high cholesterol or
                            suffered a heart attack or stroke at an early age.
                          </p>
                        </li>

                      <p>
                        A lipid or blood cholesterol panel will be needed as
                        part of this evaluation. This blood test measures the
                        amount of fatty substances (called lipids) in your
                        blood. You may have to fast (not eat for a period of
                        time) before having your blood drawn.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        If there is any question about your risk of ASCVD, or
                        whether you might benefit from drug therapy, your care
                        provider may make additional assessments or order
                        additional tests. The results of these tests can help
                        you and your health care team decide what might be the
                        best treatment for you. These tests may include:

                      <p>
                        Before coming up with a specific treatment plan, your
                        care provider will talk with you about options for
                        lowering your blood cholesterol and reducing your
                        personal risk of atherosclerotic disease. This will
                        likely include a discussion about heart-healthy living
                        and whether you might benefit from a
                        cholesterol-lowering medication.

                      <p>
                        Adopting a heart-healthy lifestyle continues to be the
                        first and best way to lower your risk of problems. Doing
                        so can also help control or prevent other risk factors
                        (for example: high blood pressure or diabetes). Experts

                      <p>
                        There are two types of cholesterol-lowering medications:
                        statins and non-statins.
                      </p>
                      <h3>Statin Therapy</h3>
                      <p>
                        There is a large body of evidence that shows the use of
                        a statin provides the greatest benefit and fewest safety
                        issues. In particular, specific groups of patients
                        appear to benefit most from taking moderate or
                        high-intensity statin therapy. Based on this
                        information, your care provider will likely recommend a
                        statin if you have:

                            are between 40 and 75 years of age

                        In certain cases, your care provider may still recommend
                        a statin even if you don't fit into one of the groups
                        above. He/she will consider your overall health and
                        other factors to help decide if you are at enough risk
                        to benefit from a statin. Based on the guidelines, these

                            tolerate it. This may be more appropriate than

                            problems, your care provider needs to know to help
                            manage any side effects and possibly switch you to a
                            different statin.

                        access to all of ACC’s Lipid management tools from one
                        place.

                        Advice from the LDL-C Lowering Therapy tool is derived from the 2022 ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway on the Role of Non-Statin Therapies for LDL-Cholesterol Lowering in the Management of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk, meant to address current gaps in care for LDL-C lowering by providing firmer and more specific guidance on the adequacy of statin therapy and whether or when to use non-statin therapies if response to statins is deemed inadequate. The app is intended for use with patients who are currently taking or who have attempted to take a statin.

                        The ACC Statin Intolerance App guides clinicians through
                        the process of managing and treating patients who report
                        muscle symptoms while on statin therapy. The information
                        and recommendations in this app are derived from the
                        2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood
                        Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular
                        Risk in Adults, and the prescribing information for each
                        statin.

                        Hypertriglyceridemia is a tool based on the 2021 ACC
                        Expert Consensus Decision Pathway on the Management of
                        ASCVD Risk Reduction in Patients With Persistent
                        Hypertriglyceridemia. Consensus recommendations are
                        provided for clinicians and patients regarding unique
                        aspects of lifestyle interventions for management of
                        hypertriglyceridemia and the use of statins and
                        triglyceride risk-based nonstatin therapies for ASCVD
                        risk reduction in the following patient groups with
                        persistent hypertriglyceridemia:

                        The ASCVD Risk Estimator within this app offers the same functionality as ACC’s pre-existing app of the same name. It is intended as a companion tool to the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Assessment of Cardiovascular Risk and the 2018 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Management of Blood Cholesterol. This Risk Estimator enables health care providers and patients to estimate 10-year and lifetime risks for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), defined as coronary death or nonfatal myocardial infarction, or fatal or nonfatal stroke, based on the Pooled Cohort Equations and lifetime risk prediction tools. The Risk Estimator is intended for use with patients without ASCVD with a LDL-cholesterol <190 mg/dL.

                        Tools within the app were designed and vetted through collaboration with writing committee members from each of the ACC clinical policy source documents, members of the LDL Think Tank Work Group, and the ACC Best Practices and Quality Improvement Subcommittee. It was further refined via user testing with physicians, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and other specialties.
